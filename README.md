A little plugin that I made for a private server but feel free to use it.
For now you can automatically pause the game when no one is connected and do `/pause on/off` in game.


### Downloading

Go to the [Action](https://github.com/JojoFR1/Auto-Pause/actions) Tab and download the latest checked version.

When downloaded, unzip it and place the plugin in your server folder `(SERVER)/config/mods`.
